# Competitive Programming Toolkit

A curated collection of solutions, utilities, and reference material created during my competitive programming class.  
It features problem implementations, practice scripts, and a carefully crafted cheatsheet designed to summarize essential algorithms, 
data structures, and common coding patterns.

## ðŸš€ Overview

This repository serves as both a **study aid** and a **showcase** of my work in competitive programming:
- **Problem solutions** in C++.
- **Reusable snippets** and helper utilities for common algorithmic tasks.
- A **Cheatsheet** distilling key algorithms, complexity analysis, coding idioms, and debugging tips.
- **Workflow strategies** for practicing efficiently and preparing for contests.

## ðŸ§  Cheatsheet

The included **[Competitive Programming Cheatsheet](cheatsheet.pdf)** is one of the highlights of this project, a condensed, quick-reference guide to the most important tools and techniques in competitive programming.  
It covers:
- Common data structures and operations.
- Graph algorithms and traversal templates.
- Disjoint Set Union (Union-Find) patterns.
- Segment trees, Fenwick trees, and range queries.
- Complexity reminders and practical debugging tips.

## ðŸ™Œ Acknowledgements

This class was a fantastic learning experience, thanks in large part to my amazing teammates from **Owlgorithms** â€” [Liel Amar](https://github.com/lielamar) and Eliav Dayanof.  
They contributed to several of the solutions, helped build the cheatsheet, and were outstanding learning partners throughout the course.
